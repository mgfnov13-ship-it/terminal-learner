# Reviewer & verifier prompts + the findings contract

Copy-paste templates for the `Task` subagents. Fill the `{PLACEHOLDERS}`. Reviewers run in parallel (one
message, N `Task` calls); verifiers run in a second parallel round. **Reviewers and verifiers are
read-only — they return text, they never edit files.**

---

## The findings contract (every reviewer returns exactly this)

Tell each reviewer to end its reply with a fenced block in this shape — nothing after it:

```json
{
  "dimension": "A11Y | PERF | MOTION | DESIGN | CODE/COPY",
  "verdict": "ship-ready | not-ship-ready",
  "summary": "one paragraph: biggest risks in this dimension",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "blocker | high | medium | low",
      "file": "path",
      "location": "selector / function / line region",
      "problem": "what's wrong, concretely",
      "fix": "the specific change to make (actual code where possible)",
      "confidence": "high | medium | low"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rule for reviewers: *prefer fewer high-confidence findings over a long speculative list; if something is
genuinely fine, do not invent a problem.*

## Shared preamble (prepend to every reviewer)

```
You are a HOSTILE, senior {DIMENSION} reviewer doing a pre-ship audit of a FINISHED frontend build.
ASSUME THE BUILD IS FLAWED and find the real problems a builder would be blind to. You are read-only:
return findings, do not edit any file.

PROJECT CONTEXT: {one paragraph — what it is, the stack, the aesthetic/Direction-Doc concept, the
intended themes/breakpoints, and anything ALREADY VERIFIED working (so you don't re-report it)}.

READ (absolute paths): {the build files relevant to your dimension} + your rubric: {rubric path}.

Optionally verify current library/API facts via Context7 / web if available; otherwise rely on the files
+ your knowledge and say so. End with the findings JSON block (see contract). Be specific and surgical.
```

## Per-dimension bodies (append after the preamble)

**A11Y** — rubric `atelier-perf-a11y/references/accessibility.md` + `atelier-perf-a11y/references/preflight-checklist.md`
```
Audit WCAG 2.2 AA: contrast of text/accent/muted in EVERY theme (compute it, don't trust tokens — the
accent-as-text on a light background is the classic fail); focus-visible on every control incl. on accent
fills; full keyboard operability (loaders skippable + non-trapping, pinned/horizontal sections not traps);
semantic HTML first — flag <div>/<span> acting as buttons/links/dialogs where a native <button>/<a href>/
<dialog>/<details name> belongs, no overridden implicit roles, every interactive element has an accessible
name; landmarks + one h1 + heading order; reduced-motion gated on EVERY motion path; prefers-reduced-
transparency honored (backdrop-filter/translucent glass falls back to a solid fill); forced-colors: active
(Windows HCM) doesn't break it — system-color keywords, focus outline kept, meaningful icons not dropped,
icon-only buttons survive; prefers-contrast: more thickens borders/text; target size >=24px (2.5.8); focus
never fully obscured by sticky header/footer/cookie bar (2.4.11 — scroll-margin/scroll-padding); every drag
interaction (slider/reorder/kanban/map) has a single-pointer tap/click alternative (2.5.7); auth fields
allow paste + password managers, no cognitive-test gate (3.3.8); canvas/WebGL aria-hidden WITH a real DOM
text alternative; auto-motion >5s has a pause control; color never the only signal; alt text correct.
```

**PERF** — rubric `atelier-perf-a11y/references/performance.md` + `atelier-perf-a11y/references/preflight-checklist.md`
```
Audit Core Web Vitals against the field/p75 gate — LCP <=2.5s, CLS <=0.1, INP <=200ms: is the LCP element
(usually hero text/image) eager + preloaded, not behind a lazy import; CLS from font swap on big display
type (metric-matched fallback?) and from un-reserved media / late-injected content; INP — passive listeners,
rAF-throttled, will-change scoped + released, long tasks (>50ms) split with scheduler.yield() AND a
setTimeout(0)/timing fallback kept (scheduler.yield is Chrome+FF only, NOT Safari), yielding AFTER the
visible response is painted, content-visibility not breaking scroll-trigger measurement; compositor-only
animation; heavy/3D lazy +
DPR-capped + paused offscreen/hidden; image format/size; SRI on CDN scripts (hardening).
```

**MOTION** — rubric `atelier-motion/*` + `atelier-scroll/*` + `atelier-webgl/*`
```
Trace EVERY motion path AND its reduced-motion counterpart: under reduce, is smooth-scroll skipped (not
just shortened), are reveals shown (opacity 1, no stuck transform), scramble/marquee/pin/cursor/count
all disabled or static? Do JS breakpoint gates EXACTLY match the CSS ones (px vs rem mismatch = dead zone)?
Pin/scrub distance computed in functions + invalidateOnRefresh? SplitText after fonts.ready? Any reveal
that never fires if already in view? WebGL: theme reactivity, context reuse, full dispose, offscreen/hidden
pause (no unreliable takeRecords). Cross-browser: 100svh, mix-blend-mode, oklch fallbacks, iOS/Safari, Lenis+touch.
```

**DESIGN** — rubric `atelier-perf-a11y/references/anti-slop-preflight.md` + the Direction Doc
```
Two jobs. (1) Anti-slop Tells: eyebrow overuse, split-header default, zigzag/marquee repetition, hero
discipline, CTA wrap/duplicate-intent, one-accent/one-radius/one-theme locks, div-faked screenshots,
fake-precise numbers, default Inter / unjustified serif. Respect the "committed concept device" escape
hatch. (2) FIDELITY: does the built output actually deliver the Direction Doc's world, concept, signature
moment, palette mood, type voice, density? Walk it in BOTH themes — does the accent stay AA as text on the
light surface, do hairlines read, does any element break on theme flip?
```

**CODE/COPY** (large builds only)
```
Dead/duplicate/contradictory CSS; selectors that match nothing in the markup; contract drift between the
spec and the build; re-read every visible string for broken/AI-cute copy and unclear referents; flag
fake-precise numbers that aren't real or labelled mock.
```

---

## The adversarial verifier (second round — refute each finding)

For each non-trivial finding, spawn a verifier (batch several per agent if many). Threshold: keep a
finding only if it is NOT refuted by the majority of its verifiers.

```
You are a skeptical verifier. Try to REFUTE this finding from a {DIMENSION} build review. Decide whether
it is REAL and WORTH FIXING, or a false positive (not actually broken / already handled elsewhere / the
proposed fix would break something / it's an intentional, consistent concept device). Read the cited
file(s) to check. DEFAULT TO refuted=true when uncertain — we want only findings that genuinely survive
scrutiny.

FINDING: {paste the finding object}

Return: {"refuted": true|false, "reason": "...", "fix_is_correct": true|false, "corrected_fix": "...if the
finding is real but the proposed fix is wrong"}.
```

**Diverse lenses:** when a finding can fail in more than one way, give its verifiers *different* angles
(does-it-reproduce / is-the-fix-safe / is-it-actually-spec'd) instead of N identical skeptics — diversity
catches more than redundancy.
